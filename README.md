Open PS2 Loader Updater is a tool that allows you to quickly update Open PS2 Loader on your PS2 to the latest available beta build. All it takes is turning on your PS2, starting the FTP Server and running this program.

No need to use any USB devices to transfer the program.

### Manual
The point of this app is to quickly update OPL on your PS2.
Open PS2 Loader's latest version is always available here: https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader/releases/download/latest/OPNPS2LD.7z

Your computer and PS2 needs to be on the same network so they can communicate with each other.
Ideally your PS2 is connected to your router and you're connected to your router using WiFi or Ethernet.

We're gonna use uLaunchELF's built in FTP Server as our FTP Server of choice. You will have to configure it's network.
From uLaunchELF select `Configure` -> `Network Settings` and configure network.

To start the FTP Server, launch `uLaunchELF` -> `FileBrowser` -> `MISC` -> `PS2Net`.
You will see your PS2's IP Address on top of the screen.
